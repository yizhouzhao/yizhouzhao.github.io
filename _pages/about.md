I am a Solution Architect at NVIDIA, where he specializes in designing and deploying advanced AI and robotics solutions. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), under the guidance of Professors [Song-Chun Zhu](https://www.zhusongchun.net/) and [Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/). 

My research goal is to develop intelligent robots that can reason and collaborate with humans for the common good. My primary focus lies in Simuliation-to-Reality (Sim2Real), particularly in robotic simulation and robot manipulation.
