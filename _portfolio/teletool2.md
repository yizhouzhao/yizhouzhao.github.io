Usage
-----
To use TeleTool2, you need to specify the IP address and port of your target server within the app. The application utilizes ARKit on your iPhone to track the camera's position and rotation in real time. This data is then transmitted to the server via a socket connection, enabling remote systems to receive and process the camera's movement and orientation information seamlessly.
